# Processed Data
This folder contains all the processed data diles corresponding to 12 epigenetic factors and the CAGE expression. The 10 histone modification files contain the ChIP-seq peak values of 154031 GENCODE TSS groups in various Cell types (see the first line for cell type names). All the other files are also organized similarly. The CpG methylation file contains the normalized CpG methylation status of a broad region, the DHS_len file contains merged length of neighboring DHSs and the CAGE file contains the normalized expression value of tag clusters corresponding to the 154031 GENCODE TSS groups.
